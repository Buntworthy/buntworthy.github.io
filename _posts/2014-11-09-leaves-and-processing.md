### Leaves
I really love this (google image search found) picture of a leaf pattern:

Should get round to making an implementation of the venetian leaf pattern algorithm for processing. Once the leaf pattern is running, thinking about the shading will be interesting.

### All RGB
Revisiting [my implementation](http://www.cutsquash.com/2014/03/photo-colour-sorting/) of the [All RGB algorithm](http://joco.name/2014/03/02/all-rgb-colors-in-one-image/) in processing and playing with other distance criteria and adding noise produces some neat effects:
