## Leaves and Processing

### Leaves
I really love this (google image search found) picture of a leaf pattern:

Should get round to making an implementation of the venetian leaf pattern algorithm for processing. Once the leaf pattern is running, thinking about the shading will be interesting.

### All RGB
Revisiting my All RGB algorithm implementation in processing and playing with other distance criteria and adding noise produces some neat effects:
