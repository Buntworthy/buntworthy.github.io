description: A plain image and text file diary
---

Diaries have to be durable and robust to changes in technology, the only real option is plain text files and image files. I wanted to keep a communal diary, with a simple mobile-centric posting interface, and plain text/image saving. Pittd (Plain image and text diary) is my solution.

Rather than re-writing a messaging app (and making a mobile app) Pittd is based on Telegram. It runs a bot that records all posts to a given message group to a plain text diary format and saves copies of any images. Pittd also contains a simple Flask application for viewing your diary entries.
