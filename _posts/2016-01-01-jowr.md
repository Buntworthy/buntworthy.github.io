description: Making OpenCV and Python better friends.
---

jowr is a bunch of helper functions and utilities which make using the OpenCV Python interface a bit friendlier.

jowr is a work in progress, currently it only really covers reading frames from a video or camera source, and camera calibration.

See the [code](https://github.com/Buntworthy/jowr) and the [documentation](http://jowr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
