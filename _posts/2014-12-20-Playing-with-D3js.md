I recently hooked a Raspberry Pi based temperature monitor (in order to settle debates about what the best schedule for the heating is) according to the useful [Adafruit tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/dht-humidity-sensing-on-raspberry-pi-with-gdocs-logging). The Google docs based method for logging and viewing the data is nice and easy to get working, but a bit unsatisfactory.

Looking for a better way sent me on some long and complicated tour of web technologies I didn't know much about, and also happily introduced by to the wonderful [D3js](http://d3js.org/). It's amazing and powerful and pretty intimidating but there are some [great](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345) [resources](https://leanpub.com/D3-Tips-and-Tricks/read) available for learning. Still a lot to learn, but I like it so far! This will become a proper blog post with details at some point. 

But for now, a link to my in progress [temperature charts](http://www.cutsquash.com/temperature.html), and a screenshot:
