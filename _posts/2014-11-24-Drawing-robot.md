I really really want to make a drawing robot. They are super cool and there are so many available and amazing designs available online:

* [Tiny CNC](http://plotterbot.com/2013/12/how-to-build-a-tiny-3-axis-cnc-drawing-robot/)
* [Piccolo](http://www.piccolo.cc/)
* [Patrick](http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~ma701pt/patricktresset/)
* [Harvey Moon](http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/show/robot-art-harvey-moons-drawing-machines)
* [Polargraph](http://www.polargraph.co.uk/)
* [WaterColorBot](http://watercolorbot.com/)

For now at least I'll just work on the drawing algorithms
