My biophysics phd was focused on single molecule fluorescence methods for studying DNA-protein interactions. Specifically I used single molecule methods such as FRET (Forster resonance energy transfer), PIFE (protein induced fluorescence enhancement), and an method I developed, TFM (tethered fluorophore motion), to study a range of DNA processing proteins (DNA polymerase, recombinases, and motor proteins).
