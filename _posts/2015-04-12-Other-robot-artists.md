I absolutely love it when people make use of an build on what silly things I've been messing around with (makes the whole endeavour feal much more worthwhile). After posting some of my recent code from [messing around with drawing algorithms](http://buntworthy.github.io/Robot-artist-revisted/) in Processing, Tomasz took my code, made it (waaay) faster, more flexible, and in colour. He gets some really nice results, you can see on [his blog](http://generateme.tumblr.com/post/115931019500/generative-drawing-based-on-justins-work-and), and his code is [available on Github](https://github.com/tsulej/GenerateMe/tree/master/drawing_strokes). I ran some of my original images through his sketch, and I'm really impressed by the variety of styles it produces.
