title: Webcam Field of Views

I spent too much time looking at/buying webcams today. A not frequently obviously stated, yet very useful parameter is the field of view of the webcam. Happily this information does exist, it's just sometimes a bit buried. So here is a list of what I came across.

| Model                       | FOV (degrees, diagonal unless otherwise stated) |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Logitech   C160             | 50                                                |
| Logitech   C170             | 58                                                |
