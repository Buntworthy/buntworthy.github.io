description: Meal idea index
---

It's hard deciding what to eat, every week you have to pick seven new things, and every week there are lots of things I think I would like to make or eat. But whenever I come to the point of planning the meals for a week I draw a blank.

Meals is a small Python app to act as a way of storing an index of meal ideas. These aren't recipes, I know how to cook things, or I can check if I can't remember. This is just a simple, searchable meal index I can keep updated with things I typically cook.
