Still working on some temperature charts with D3. ~~Almost ready for~~ [a real blog post](http://www.cutsquash.com/2015/01/simple-temperature-logger/), in the mean time there is at least a [Github repository of my code](https://github.com/Buntworthy/tempLogger).

Update: And now a brief post describing the [temperature logger](http://www.cutsquash.com/2015/01/simple-temperature-logger/), and the (non-live) [temperature charts](http://cutsquash.com/temperature/).
