Thinking about algorithms for a drawing robot [again](http://buntworthy.github.io/Drawing-robot/). The [e-David painting robot](http://www.informatik.uni-konstanz.de/en/edavid/) seems to achieve really nice results, with what seems like a fairly simple algorithm. So inspired by that overall scheme are some Processing based sketches for some simple error based line drawing algorithms.

The (totally uncommented) code is [on Github](https://github.com/Buntworthy/Processing).
