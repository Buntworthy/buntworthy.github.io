I was surprisingly impressed by the 3D effect of a 3D TV, and also how easy it is to make content for it. Having seen Johnny Lee's excellent Wii head tracking videos from a while ago, I think combining head tracking with stereoscopic 3D would be super cool!

Thanks to Processing, OpenCV, and Blender getting started with these things is super easy!
