ColourSorter takes the pixels of an image and re-arranges them based on their colour. The algorithm was inspired by JÃ³zsef Fejes's all RGB sorting, with small parameter and option variations producing a wide variety of outputs.

The application is written in Java, the source is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/Buntworthy/ColourSorter).
