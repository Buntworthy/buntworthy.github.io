A long time ago I used to have a food blog, and along with that I made a silly random recipe generator. Deliberately designed to not be affected by historical biases for ingredient combinations we humans are, it produces some odd and improbably dishes. It's written in Processing and exists in the form of a [little website](http://www.cutsquash.com/processing/recipe_generator/recipeGeneratorv3.html) and an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cutsquash.randomrecipegenerator).
