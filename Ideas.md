Some ideas I had:

* Randomly generated landscapes shown on e-ink display
* Long exposure images of things collapsing in Blender
* Analysis of Google search/Chrome browsing history
* Personal weather forecast (i.e. commute conditions, temperature preferances)

### Computational photography

* SIFT based collage/reconstruction
* Face detection collage/reverse collage
* Spatially varying shutter speed image
* Additive (background subtracted) day time long exposure
* Non-linear slit-scan

### Apps

* Computer vision pasta shape identification app
* Microlife calculator (see http://journals.bmj.com/site/microlives/)
* Tea brewing timer that shows an appropriate length YouTube video

### Learning projects to try

* Bag of words fruit identifier
* Depth from focus
* Webserver controlled Fadecandy LED lamp
* MySQL Raspberry Pi temperature logger

### Completed

* [Raspberry Pi temperature logger](http://www.cutsquash.com/2015/01/simple-temperature-logger/)
* [Visualising SIFT features](http://www.cutsquash.com/2014/11/visualising-sift-descriptors/)
